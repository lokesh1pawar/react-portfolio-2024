Imagine giving a text a voice and transforming words into a natural speech. In the realm of [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.comet.com%2Fsite%2Fblog%2Fnatural-language-processing-with-r%2F), the evolution of technology has paved the way for innovative solutions, and one such marvel is Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. This cutting-edge technology has various applications ranging from assistive devices to interactive storytelling.

While pre-trained models abound, building your own unlocks customization and fine-tuning. You can tailor the voice output to specific tasks or domains, adding a touch of uniqueness. Moreover, the process deepens your understanding of TTS algorithms and opens doors to further experimentation.

You can build your own TTS system, harnessing the power of [Python](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.python.org%2F) and [Comet ML](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.comet.com%2Fsite%2F). Python is a programming language with various libraries and beginner-friendly syntax, making it the perfect coding playground. You can leverage libraries like [TensorFlow](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tensorflow.org%2F) or [PyTorch](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpytorch.org%2F) for deep learning, [NLTK](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nltk.org%2F) for text cleaning, an inbuilt [transformers](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpypi.org%2Fproject%2Ftransformers%2F) for text preprocessing, and [NumPy](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnumpy.org%2F) for data manipulation. On the other hand, Comet ML is your experiment tracking partner, which will ensure clarity and reproducibility, letting you compare different model versions and optimize your creation.

In this hands-on guide, we will embark on a journey to craft a voice for your text, step by step. This article delves into the intricacies of building a custom TTS system, exploring the significance of composing personalized solutions and leveraging the power of Python and Comet ML. We will also be using [streamlit](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstreamlit.io%2F) to create a beautiful frontend for our text to speech system.

## Setting the Stage: Preparing the Environment
Before we dive into code, let's assemble our tools. First, open your [Jupyter Notebook](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjupyter.org%2F) (or [Google Colaboratory](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcolab.research.google.com%2F)) or any other coding IDE you like. However, if you are using Jupyter Notebook, create a new [Anaconda environment](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fconda.io%2Fprojects%2Fconda%2Fen%2Flatest%2Fuser-guide%2Ftasks%2Fmanage-environments.html%23activating-an-environment) first to avoid conflicts, then open Notebook into that environment.

### Installing Necessary Libraries and Packages
Now install the necessary libraries in the new Anaconda environment from Notebook itself with the help of [PIP](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpip.pypa.io%2Fen%2Fstable%2Finstallation%2F). Install essential libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning capabilities. Additionally, install text preprocessing libraries to streamline data preparation, TTS libraries like [gTTS](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpypi.org%2Fproject%2FgTTS%2F) and [Tacotron2](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpypi.org%2Fproject%2Ftacotron2%2F), and data manipulation libraries like [NumPy](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnumpy.org%2F) and [Pandas](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpandas.pydata.org%2F). With the power of Python, you lay the groundwork for a flexible and dynamic development environment.

```python
!pip install streamlit transformers torchaudio sentencepiece soundfile comet_ml
```

### Acquiring Datasets for Training and Testing
The quality of your TTS system or any AI system depends on the datasets used for training and testing. Explore diverse datasets to ensure your model adapts well to distinguish linguistic nuances.

You can search for large audio datasets paired with their corresponding text scripts. Standard TTS dataset options include [LJSpeech](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkeithito.com%2FLJ-Speech-Dataset%2F), [LibriSpeech](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.openslr.org%2F12), and [VCTK](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpaperswithcode.com%2Fdataset%2Fvctk). Remember, the quality and variety of your data shapes the quality and versatility of your final voice output.

We will be using the '[Matthijs/cmu-arctic-xvectors](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggingface.co%2Fdatasets%2FMatthijs%2Fcmu-arctic-xvectors)' dataset from the datasets library although you can choose whichever data you find suitable for you.

## Building the Text-to-Speech Model
### Choice of TTS Architecture
Selecting the appropriate TTS architecture is pivotal. Whether it's [Tacotron Transformer](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggingface.co%2Ftensorspeech%2Ftts-tacotron2-ljspeech-en), or a hybrid model, understanding the nuances of each architecture is crucial for optimal performance. Consider the nature of your application and the specific requirements for voice clarity and naturalness.

Here's where the magic happens! We will choose a TTS architecture, like Tacotron2, a powerful sequence-to-sequence model that masters converting text into [mel-spectrograms](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/understanding-the-mel-spectrogram-fca2afa2ce53), the intermediate representation of speech. The deep learning framework takes the reins, training the model to map text sequences to these spectrograms. Finally, we'll use a [vocoder](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FVocoder) like [HifiGAN](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggingface.co%2Fnvidia%2Ftts_hifigan) to reconstruct the audio waveform from the mel-spectrograms, breathing life into our text.

### Using the Pre-trained TTS Model
Leverage pre-trained TTS models as a starting point. These pre-trained models not only accelerate development but also ensure a solid foundation. Fine-tune the model on your dataset to impart a personalized touch, aligning the voice characteristics with the intended application.

We'll walk through the Python code together, demystifying each step. From data loading and preprocessing to model training and inference, we'll build an understanding of the underlying algorithms and their role in shaping your voice engine. Comet ML integration will seamlessly track your experiments, allowing you to analyze, compare, and improve your model.

### Testing the TTS System with Sample Texts
Before delving into the intricacies of integration, thoroughly test your TTS system with sample texts. Evaluate the model's performance across multiple linguistic patterns, accents, and pacing to ensure a versatile and reliable output.

No masterpiece is born perfect. We will test the TTS system with sample texts, evaluating the authenticity, clarity, and emotional expressiveness. Comet ML will be your analytical partner, offering insights into model performance and guiding you toward optimization. Use these insights to fine-tune your model's hyperparameters and adjust its training process for even better results.

### Designing the Frontend 
We will use streamlit to create the web application to interact with the real world. Streamlit is a powerful Python library that provides an in-built User Interface to interact with users. Hence, you do not need to worry about creating a front-end service.

### Let's Code! 
First, import the necessary libraries like transformers, streamlit, datasets, torch, and sound files. Then load the model, text preprocessor, and vocoder from the transformers library using their respective modules. For this article, we will be using the [speecht5_tts](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggingface.co%2Fmicrosoft%2Fspeecht5_tts) model from Microsoft for converting text to speech.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import streamlit as st
import transformers
import comet_ml
# from transformers import SpeechT5Processor, SpeechT5ForTextToSpeech, SpeechT5HifiGan
from datasets import load_dataset
import torch
import soundfile as sf

# Load pre-trained T5 model and tokenizer
model = transformers.SpeechT5ForTextToSpeech.from_pretrained("microsoft/speecht5_tts")
processor = transformers.SpeechT5Processor.from_pretrained("microsoft/speecht5_tts")
vocoder = transformers.SpeechT5HifiGan.from_pretrained("microsoft/speecht5_hifigan")
```

Then create the title and input text box using streamlit.

```python
## Streamlit app header
st.title("Text-to-Speech System")

# Input text box
input_text = st.text_input("Enter Your Text Here:")
```

Now create a radio button that will convert the text into speech if the text input is given by the user otherwise, it will ask for a text input. 

```python
# Button to generate audio
if st.button("Generate Audio"):
   if input_text:
       # Tokenize and generate audio using T5 model
       inputs = processor(text=input_text, return_tensors="pt")

       # load xvector containing speaker's voice characteristics from a dataset
       embeddings_dataset = load_dataset("Matthijs/cmu-arctic-xvectors", split="validation")
       speaker_embeddings = torch.tensor(embeddings_dataset[7306]["xvector"]).unsqueeze(0)
      
       speech = model.generate_speech(inputs["input_ids"], speaker_embeddings, vocoder=vocoder)
              
       # Save the generated audio
       sf.write("speech.wav", speech.numpy(), samplerate=16000)

       # Display audio player
       st.audio("speech.wav")
   else:
       st.warning("Please enter text before generating audio.")

# Streamlit app footer
st.write("Built with ❤️")
```

Once the text input is received then the processor will tokenize and convert the text into speech. Then load the xvector containing the speaker's voice characteristics from a dataset and generate the speech from the text input as per the speaker's voice using a model and vocoder. Then save the audio file as speech.wav or any other name with a sample rate of 16000 and at last play the audio along with displaying the audio player.

## Integration with Comet ML
Comet ML serves as the maestro's baton in orchestrating your experiments. Integrate Comet ML into your workflow to track experiments seamlessly. This integration involves initializing Comet ML, logging parameters, and ensuring a smooth flow of information for comprehensive experiment tracking.

### Logging Model Performance and Training Metrics
With Comet ML, log model performance metrics during training. Monitor essential indicators like [loss](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.google.com%2Fmachine-learning%2Fcrash-course%2Fdescending-into-ml%2Ftraining-and-loss), [accuracy](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.google.com%2Fmachine-learning%2Fcrash-course%2Fclassification%2Faccuracy), and [convergence rates](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRate_of_convergence). This data not only aids in debugging but also provides insights for model refinement.

### Experiment with Versioning and Comparison
Experiment versioning allows you to track changes and improvements over time. Comet ML's versioning feature enables easy comparison between different iterations, facilitating informed decision-making. This iterative approach is pivotal in achieving a TTS system that evolves and adapts.

***Note:** For this part make sure you create an account on [comet](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.comet.com%2Fsite%2F).*

```python
import comet_ml

# Set up Comet ML for experiment tracking
comet_ml.config.save(api_key=<your api key>)
experiment = comet_ml.Experiment(project_name="text-to-speech", workspace=<your workspace name>)

# Log the experiment with Comet ML
experiment.log_parameters({"text": input_text})
```

The above code creates the experiment tracking for logging parameters for our TTS application. First, set up the Comet ML followed by defining the experiment with the project name and at last use the 'log_parameters' to track the parameters metric.

```None
